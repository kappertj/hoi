# This is all without all the nice OBC work done by other people in the old
# version,that's because upstream does not yet have proper objectBucketClaim
# support, and refuse to use the internal s3.openhishift-storage.svc endpoint
# since they don't trust the service CA by default.COmbine this with other
# irritations, and you can manually add an overlay to the gitops repo for your
# storage if you want.
#
# I hope to revisit this in the future when upstream finally realizes not
# everybody runs everything on AWS.
