# Use the storage group when deploying dedicates storage nodes that will not
# contain other general purpose application workload. For example when using
# OpenShift Container Storage. Leave the group defined but empty
# if not used. It's required during execution, has no effect when empty.
# It can be combined with other hosts and groups for shared functionality.
